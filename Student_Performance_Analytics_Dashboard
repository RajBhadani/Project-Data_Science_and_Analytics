# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance data to identify potential risk factors for academic failure or dropout.

## Task

The primary task is to analyze student data to highlight performance trends and risk areas. This involves:

- Calculating averages for marks, attendance, and logins.
- Determining the correlation between these factors.
- Assessing the impact of absenteeism on student performance.
- Visualizing the differences between top-performing and struggling students.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the `student_performance_dataset.csv` file, which contains student data with columns related to marks, attendance, and logins.

## Notebook Structure

The analysis is structured into several sections within the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **Data Loading:** Imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.
2.  **Data Exploration:** Examines the dataset's shape, data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics, and visualizes the distribution of key variables.
3.  **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, and outliers.
4.  **Data Wrangling:** Calculates average marks, attendance, and logins, and creates a combined performance score.
5.  **Data Analysis:** Analyzes the correlation between key metrics, identifies at-risk students, and segments students into performance groups.
6.  **Feature Engineering:** Creates a 'risk_score' feature.
7.  **Data Visualization:** Attempts to visualize the average marks of top vs. struggling students and the correlation matrix.

## Key Findings

Based on the analysis:

- Four students were identified as at-risk due to low performance and high absenteeism.
- A weak negative correlation was observed between attendance and marks, with a seemingly non-linear relationship requiring further investigation.
- Students were segmented into "Top Performer", "Struggling Student", and "Average" groups based on their average marks.
- Weak correlations were found between average marks, average attendance, and average logins.
- A risk score was calculated to indicate potential academic risk.

## Next Steps

- Investigate the non-linear relationship between attendance and marks in more detail.
- Address and resolve the issues with generating and displaying the data visualizations in the notebook environment.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
3.  Place the `student_performance_dataset.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.
4.  Open and run the notebook in a Jupyter environment (like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook) to reproduce the analysis.
