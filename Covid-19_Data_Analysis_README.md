## Overview

This notebook offers an in-depth analytical perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic. It explores the spread of the virus, its impact, and provides predictive insights, particularly focusing on the situation in India and comparing it with other significantly affected regions like the US, Italy, and China. The analysis leverages historical data to visualize trends and forecast future cases.

## Key Features

* **Global Data Exploration:** Analyze worldwide COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
* **India-Specific Analysis:** Detailed examination of the COVID-19 situation within India, including its current status and historical trends.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the pandemic's trajectory in India with that of other countries.
* **Case Prediction:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., Prophet) to predict future COVID-19 cases in India.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Generate interactive graphs and charts for a better understanding of the data.

## Getting Started

### Open in Google Colab

You can directly open and run this notebook in Google Colab using the following link:

[Open COVID-19 Data Analysis in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RajBhadani/Project-Data_Science_and_Analytics/blob/main/COVID_19_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you only need a Google account to access Google Colab. All necessary libraries are installed within the Colab environment.

## Analysis Performed

The notebook typically performs the following tasks:

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Reading and cleaning the COVID-19 global and India-specific datasets.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyzing the daily and cumulative trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
    * Identifying top affected countries and regions.
    * Calculating active cases and mortality rates.
* **Trend Comparison:** Visualizing and comparing the spread patterns across different countries.
* **Time Series Forecasting:** Applying forecasting models to predict future trends of COVID-19 cases, particularly for India.

## Libraries Used

The analysis in this notebook is primarily powered by the following Python libraries:

* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `datetime`: For handling date and time objects.
* `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
* `plotly.express`: For creating interactive, beautiful plots.
* `plotly.graph_objects`: For more granular control over Plotly visualizations.
* `matplotlib.pyplot`: For basic plotting.
* `fbprophet`: For time series forecasting (if prediction is included).
